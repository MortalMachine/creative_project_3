# Creative Project 2

I built upon my previous work on Creative Project 1 by adding a Youtube API to the Shows page. The Shows page has a Subscribe, Sign In, Sign Out, Like, and Dislike button.

The one caveat though is that I couldn't get the Like or Dislike buttons to work yet. I don't see the video's like/dislike count being affected by the button clicks.
